Echoes of Travian is a single-player, real-time, browser-based strategy game, based on and inspired by Travian. It's browser based and requires no downloads or account creation.
Using browser's native IndexedDb, game data is persisted and progressed between game sessions, just like you would expect from an online game.

**Note: Very much still work in progress, not much to see at the moment.**
